XV. The Lucky


Suppose he'd listened to the erudite committee,

He would have only found where not to look;

Suppose his terrier when he whistled had obeyed,

It would not have unearthed the buried city;

Suppose he had dismissed the careless maid,

The cryptogram would not have fluttered from the book.


"It was not I," he cried as, healthy and astounded,

He stepped across a predecessor's skull;

"A nonsense jingle simply came into my head

And left the intellectual Sphinx dumbfounded;

I won the Queen because my hair was red;

The terrible adventure is a little dull."


Hence Failure's torment: "Was I doomed in any case,

Or would I not have failed had I believed in Grace?" 


-W. H. Auden
